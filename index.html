          <div class="ethics-expanded">
            <p>
              ENGG 687 showed me that engineering ethics is not just about knowing
              the rules, but understanding the <strong>real impact</strong> of decisions on
              people, communities, and the environment. I learned how time pressure,
              organizational culture, and communication gaps shape engineering
              decisions. Responsibility exists at many levels: individual, team,
              organization, and society.

          <div class="ethics-expanded">
            <p>
              My biggest takeaway is that <strong>speaking up early matters</strong>. Most failures
              in engineering don’t come from one big mistake, but from small red flags
              that were ignored. ENGG 687 showed me that honesty, moral courage, and
              documentation are as essential as technical skill. Staying silent can
              cause just as much harm as making a calculation error.

              Going forward, I will integrate these lessons by questioning assumptions,
              asking for clarification when something feels uncertain, and prioritizing
              public safety. I want to contribute to a culture where teammates feel
              safe raising concerns. I will design with long-term impact in mind,
              document my reasoning clearly, and choose transparency — even when it
              feels uncomfortable.

              <p>
                The ENGG 687 lectures helped me see that engineering decisions are never purely
                technical. We explored how communication breakdowns, time pressure, and company
                culture can influence what engineers actually do in practice. Ethics appeared in
                places I hadn’t expected, like how risk is explained, how emails are written, and
                how concerns are documented.

              <p>
                I will later refine this section with 1–2 specific lecture examples (such as a
                case study or in-class discussion) and explain how they changed the way I think
                about professional responsibility, safety, and long-term impact.

              <h3>Course Reading 1 – Design for Justice</h3>
              <p>
                This reading introduced the concept of <strong>Design for Justice</strong>, which
                argues that engineering and public systems must be created with fairness,
                accessibility, and community input at the core. Rather than treating justice as an
                afterthought, it showed how ethical systems start with the people most affected —
                especially those historically marginalized by design decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                What struck me most was the idea that engineers must ask
                <strong>who benefits, who is excluded, and who bears the risk</strong>. Design for
                Justice pushed me to see that technical decisions always reflect values and power
                structures. I will later add a concrete example here, such as infrastructure,
                transportation, or sensing systems that disproportionately affect certain groups.

              <h3>Course Reading 2 – Design for Safety</h3>
              <p>
                The <strong>Design for Safety</strong> reading helped me understand that safety is not
                something added at the end of a project, but a design philosophy that must be
                present from the start. It highlighted how many failures come not from a single
                mistake, but from small overlooked assumptions, rushed decisions, and unclear
                communication about risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reading emphasized that engineers must expect misuse, human error, and changing
                real-world conditions. I plan to later connect this to a specific case study (like
                Challenger or Walkerton) and reflect on how I can design with redundancy, clear
                documentation, and public safety as the first priority.

              <h3>Suggested Material 1 – Doughnut Economics</h3>
              <p>
                For Suggested Material 1, I explored <strong>Doughnut Economics</strong> by Kate
                Raworth, a framework that balances <strong>social foundations</strong> (basic human
                needs) with <strong>planetary boundaries</strong> (ecological limits). The “doughnut”
                represents a safe and just space for humanity, where people’s needs are met without
                overshooting environmental limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                This framework is very relevant to engineering: power systems, infrastructure, and
                embedded technologies all have environmental and social impacts. I will later add a
                specific engineering example — such as energy planning or sustainable mobility — to
                show how this idea shapes the way I want to design systems.

              <h3>Suggested Material 2 – “Generative AI is a Climate Disaster”</h3>
              <p>
                For Suggested Material 2, I looked at the argument that
                <strong>generative AI has a significant climate impact</strong>. Training large AI
                models consumes huge amounts of electricity, water, and hardware resources, often
                powered by grids that still rely on fossil fuels. The article emphasized that
                “virtual” does not mean “impact-free.”
              </p>

                This topic connects closely to ENGG 687 themes of transparency and sustainability.
                I will later add specific figures or examples (such as data center water usage or
                carbon emissions from AI training) and reflect on how engineers can design and
                deploy AI more responsibly, with honest reporting of environmental costs.

              <h3>Teamwork Reflection</h3>
              <p>
                Our ENGG 687 team project showed me how important clear roles, documentation, and
                open communication are. At the beginning, our tasks overlapped and we sometimes
                assumed others were handling things that weren’t clearly assigned. Once we agreed on
                responsibilities and created a shared plan, our workflow improved significantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                A powerful case we discussed was the <strong>Deepwater Horizon oil spill</strong>,
                where miscommunication, ignored warnings, and unclear leadership contributed to a
                catastrophic failure. It was a reminder that even highly skilled teams can fail if
                people don’t share information or feel safe raising concerns. I want to carry these
                lessons into future projects by listening carefully, asking questions, and supporting
                a culture where safety concerns are taken seriously.

              <h3>Looking Back 1 – My Final Year Autonomous Vehicle Project</h3>

              <p><strong>The Gap Year Grind That Built My Foundation</strong></p>
              <p>
                My final year project wasn’t supposed to happen. I took a gap year after struggling
                with grades, questioning whether engineering was even the right path for me. But when
                I returned, I committed everything to building an <strong>autonomous vehicle prototype</strong>—a
                Raspberry Pi-powered rover equipped with obstacle avoidance, line-following, and basic
                path-planning. It relied on ultrasonic sensors, motor drivers, and custom PID controllers.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What I Set Out to Do vs. Reality</strong></p>
              <p>
                The plan was simple: build a competition-ready robot that could navigate complex tracks
                in under 30 seconds. The reality was months of debugging GPIO pin conflicts at 2 AM,
                motors blowing out due to overcurrent, and a sensor fusion algorithm that kept driving
                us straight into walls. We went through five hardware revisions and rewrote our entire
                state machine twice. But on demo day? It worked—barely—but it worked.
              </p>

              <p><strong>The Brutal Lessons</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Microcontrollers Don’t Forgive Sloppiness:</strong>
                  One floating pin nearly fried our entire board. Now I triple-check every datasheet
                  and always use pull-up resistors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Autonomy = Relentless Testing:</strong>
                  Simulations lied to us. Real-world latency, lighting changes, and battery sag humbled me.
                  This is when I learned to love oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Teamwork Under Fire:</strong>
                  We argued for weeks about I²C vs. SPI. Turns out, the real skill is knowing when to pivot,
                  listen, and appreciate your teammate’s fix.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Why This Project Changed Everything</strong></p>
              <p>
                That gap year was the best decision I ever made. The project wasn’t just an academic task—
                it was my initiation into embedded systems, ROS basics, and designing hardware that doesn’t
                fall apart under pressure. During my first internship interview, they spent nearly 40 minutes
                asking about this single project. Every line of C, every solder joint, and every last-minute
                bug fix taught me how to survive real engineering chaos.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Where I Am Now</strong></p>
              <p>
                I now begin every project by setting a “failure budget”—time dedicated entirely to the
                unexpected issues that always show up. And there’s still nothing more satisfying than
                watching my rover's code run flawlessly on the first try.
              </p>

              <h3>Looking Back 2 – From Quiet Wardha Streets to Calgary’s Wide-Open Skies</h3>

              <p><strong>Small-Town Roots, Big-City Growth</strong></p>
              <p>
                I grew up in Wardha, a peaceful town in central India where everyone knows your family,
                cows have the right of way, and the loudest noise is the evening aarti from the temple.
                Life moved slowly—walking to Alphonsa School, weekend trips to Sevagram Ashram, and
                summer evenings playing cricket under streetlights. Things were simple, affordable, and
                deeply connected. I could study late at the local library for free, eat a full vegetarian
                thali for ₹50, and feel completely safe cycling home at 10 PM.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then I moved to Calgary, Canada. Suddenly everything felt huge: wide roads, endless blue
                skies, and winters that drop to –30°C. My first grocery bill shocked me, rent took half
                my part-time pay, and I missed the chaos of street vendors and spontaneous chats with
                neighbors. For months I complained about how “cold” everything felt—both the weather
                and the people.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What I Learned Along the Way</strong></p>
              <p>
                Wardha taught me resourcefulness. When components for my final-year autonomous vehicle
                project were delayed, we built our own sensor mounts from scrap wood and fixed motors
                with whatever spare parts the local electronics shop had. Calgary taught me structure:
                deadlines are real, transit runs on time, and “I’ll finish it tomorrow” doesn’t work
                in group projects or at work.
              </p>

              <p>
                Small-city life gave me community; big-city life gave me independence. In Wardha,
                aunties checked if I ate lunch. In Calgary, I learned to cook dal from scratch, shovel
                snow off my sidewalk, and ask strangers for help without feeling shy.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How the Move Shaped Me</strong></p>
              <p>
                Today I carry the best of both worlds. Wardha’s calmness helps me stay grounded during
                long coding sessions and tough deadlines. Calgary’s opportunities pushed me to build
                real-world projects, land internships, and now study at the University of Calgary—
                just a quick LRT ride from my place near Dalhousie Station.
              </p>

              <p>
                Living in two such different places made me adaptable, grateful, and more confident.
                I still smile when I smell fresh pav bhaji on 17th Avenue—it reminds me of home. And
                when the Rockies turn pink at sunset, I realize how far I’ve come.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                “Wardha showed me how to dream in a small town. Calgary taught me how to chase those dreams in a big world.”

          From opening up old remotes in Wardha to hiking the Rockies in Alberta –

        <div class="life-story-body">
          <p>
            Since my earliest years, I’ve been the kind of kid who took apart remote
            controls and old radios just to see how they worked. That childhood
            curiosity for electrical and computer components never left me — it only
            grew stronger, shaping every academic and life decision I’ve made since.
          </p>

          <p>
            My formal journey began in Maharashtra, India. In 2017 I passed Class 10
            (CBSE) with Distinction (8.4/10), and in 2019 I completed Class 12
            (Maharashtra State Board) with a focus on Information Technology. Driven
            by a deep passion for technology and innovation, I joined the Electronics
            and Telecommunication Engineering program at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of
            Technology, Pimpri — an NAAC A-accredited institute permanently affiliated
            with Savitribai Phule Pune University. Four intense and rewarding years
            later, in June 2023, I graduated with First Class with Distinction and a
            CGPA of 8.37.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those undergraduate years were transformative. I designed motion-detecting
            smart street lighting systems with gas-leak alerts, built autonomous vehicle
            prototypes, and spent countless nights simulating circuits in Proteus and
            MATLAB. Beyond the classroom, I led juniors as Assistant Digital Head of
            Team TESA (the college technical club), organised national-level events like
            Robo Wrestling and Avishkar as a Senior Technical Member of the IETE Club,
            and earned certifications in AWS Cloud Technical Essentials, Data Analytics,
            Machine Learning, and Six Sigma. Every project, workshop, and late-night
            debugging session reinforced one truth: I love solving real-world problems
            with hardware and software working together.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2023 I took the biggest leap of my life — I moved halfway across the
            world to pursue a Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
            University of Calgary, Canada. Leaving behind family, friends, and the
            familiar chaos of Pune roads wasn’t easy, but the moment I saw the
            Canadian Rockies rising against the skyline, I knew I had made the right
            choice.

            Canada has given me more than an excellent education; it has given me a
            completely new perspective. On weekends I trade laptops for hiking boots
            and explore the trails of Banff, Kananaskis, and Jasper. I’ve stood
            speechless at the turquoise waters of Lake Louise and Moraine Lake,
            summited Ha Ling Peak and Tent Ridge, and have done more “unmanly”
            (read: slightly terrifying but incredibly beautiful) solo hikes than I can
            count. Every glacier, waterfall, and snowy peak reminds me how vast the
            world is — and how much more there is to explore, both in nature and in
            technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, as I work toward my graduate degree, I carry with me the rigor of an
            Indian engineering education, the hands-on experience of leading technical
            teams, and the quiet confidence that comes from standing on a mountain top
            watching the sunrise over the Rockies.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still the same kid who loved taking things apart — except now I’m
            building smarter systems, writing better code, and dreaming bigger. Whether
            it’s designing the next generation of intelligent electrical systems or
            discovering the next hidden alpine lake, I’m just getting started.
