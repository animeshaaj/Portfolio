        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hii, I am a MEng student specializing in Electrical and Computer Engg at the University of Calgary.
          I am passionate about sustainable engineering and embedded systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building practical solutions that combine electronics, software, and responsible design.
          My journey has taken me from electronics and telecommunication in my undergrad
          to working as a React.js intern, and now exploring engineering ethics and professional practice in ENGG 687.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Bring</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Strong foundation in embedded systems, power electronics, and programming.</li>
          <li>Experience working in diverse and collaborative teams.</li>
          <li>Ethical, community-focused mindset with a willingness to keep learning.</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="section-sub">
        Key reflections and learnings from ENGG 687 – Ethics, Law, and the Engineering Profession.
      </p>

      <div class="cards-grid">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Engineering Ethics &amp; Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            Ethical engineering is more than following rules; it means protecting people, society,
            and the environment. I learned how real decisions happen in messy, ambiguous situations,
            where honesty and moral courage really matter.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Course Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            Case studies like Challenger and Walkerton showed how system-level issues, communication gaps,
            and culture can lead to failure. I now see engineering as balancing technical innovation
            with long-term responsibility.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Reading Reflections</h3>
          <p>
            Readings on moral courage and unintended consequences helped me reflect on when to speak up,
            how designs affect real people, and why context matters just as much as calculations.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Suggested Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Additional resources on professional responsibility and sustainability reinforced that
            transparency, accountability, and environmental awareness are core parts of being an engineer.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Teamwork Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Our project experience showed that clear roles, communication, and listening to each other
            are essential. Once we organized ourselves, our teamwork and outcomes improved a lot.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Looking Back &amp; My Choice</h3>
          <p>
            Early in the course, ethics felt overwhelming. Now I see it as a skill I can grow. I chose
            <strong>resilience</strong> as my key attribute—staying focused under pressure, adapting, and learning from every challenge.
