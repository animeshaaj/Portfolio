        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hii, I am a MEng student specializing in Electrical and Computer Engg at the University of Calgary.
          I am passionate about sustainable engineering and embedded systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building practical solutions that combine electronics, software, and responsible design.
          My journey has taken me from electronics and telecommunication in my undergrad
          to working as a React.js intern, and now exploring engineering ethics and professional practice in ENGG 687.

              <h3>What I Learned</h3>
              <p>
                ENGG 687 showed me that engineering ethics is not just about knowing
                the rules, but about understanding the <strong>real impact</strong> of
                decisions on people, communities, and the environment. I learned how
                factors like time pressure, workplace culture, and communication gaps
                can influence what engineers do in practice. Responsibility exists at
                many levels: individual, team, organization, and society.

              <h3>My Biggest Takeaway</h3>
              <p>
                My biggest takeaway is that <strong>speaking up early matters</strong>.
                Many failures in the case studies did not come from a single bad
                decision, but from small concerns that were ignored or left unspoken.
                Moral courage, clear documentation, and honest communication are just
                as important as technical skills. As an engineer, staying silent can be
                as harmful as making a wrong calculation.

              <p>
                Going forward, I will integrate these lessons by consciously
                <strong>questioning assumptions</strong>, asking for clarification when
                something feels uncertain, and prioritizing public safety over
                convenience or speed. I want to contribute to a culture where teammates
                feel safe raising concerns. In my projects and future roles, I will
                design with long-term impacts in mind, document my reasoning clearly,
                and choose transparency even when it is uncomfortable.

          <h3>Engineering Ethics &amp; Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            Ethical engineering is more than following rules; it means protecting people, society,
            and the environment. I learned how real decisions happen in messy, ambiguous situations,
            where honesty and moral courage really matter.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card reveal">
          <h3>Course Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            Case studies like Challenger and Walkerton showed how system-level issues, communication gaps,
            and culture can lead to failure. I now see engineering as balancing technical innovation
            with long-term responsibility.

        <article class="card reveal">
          <h3>Reading Reflections</h3>
          <p>
            Readings on moral courage and unintended consequences helped me reflect on when to speak up,
            how designs affect real people, and why context matters just as much as calculations.

        </article>

        <article class="card reveal">
          <h3>Suggested Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Additional resources on professional responsibility and sustainability reinforced that
            transparency, accountability, and environmental awareness are core parts of being an engineer.

          <h3>Teamwork Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Our project experience showed that clear roles, communication, and listening to each other
            are essential. Once we organized ourselves, our teamwork and outcomes improved a lot.

            Early in the course, ethics felt overwhelming. Now I see it as a skill I can grow. I chose
            <strong>resilience</strong> as my key attribute—staying focused under pressure, adapting, and learning from every challenge.
